# Top Navigation Bar

Atop each page of the [NFT-TiX](https://nft-tix.com/) website is a Top Navigation Bar which contains shortcuts to the most-used website functionality. 

Of particular interest are the action-oriented entry points: events (for browsing by event type), marketplace (for browsing with more advanced filtering), and the user account shortcut (for accessing per-user settings).

The informational entry points, **For Organizers** and **How It Works** provide painless transitions into concepts and workflows central to NFT-TiX.

## Events

Mousing over the [Events](https://nft-tix.com/events) element shows a pop-up with the various event types. This is the quickest way to begin browsing tickets for purchase.

## Marketplace

[Marketplace](https://nft-tix.com/marketplace) is similar to Events. More detailed filtering options make it even easier to winnow out events which aren't currently of interest.

## For organizers
