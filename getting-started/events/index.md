# Events

Events are what NFT-TiX are all about! Many paths through our site — including browsing and searching — will lead you to a special event. All event pages have contain the event's basic information, one or more tiers of tickets, and other events put on by that organisation. 

The top of this page describes the event details, the bottom the purchasing experience.

Each event page looks similar to the following screenshot.

The event ticket tier portion will show at least one ticket type; often more. The event shown here has:

* Silver — One-day day & night 
* Gold — Two-day day & night
* Platinum — One-day VIP lounge day & night
